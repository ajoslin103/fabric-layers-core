# Conceptual Guide to Using Fabric Layers Core

## Mental Model

When approaching the fabric-layers-core library, it helps to think of it as a specialized mapping system built on canvas technology. Consider these key mental models:

### Canvas as a World

Think of the canvas as an infinite 2D world with its own coordinate system. The Map component provides your viewport into this world, allowing you to:

- Navigate (pan) around this world
- Change your level of detail (zoom)
- Add visual elements (layers) to specific coordinates
- Interact with these elements in different ways

### Layered Visualization

Imagine the map as a stack of transparent sheets (layers), each containing different elements:

- Base layers for background elements
- Feature layers for interactive elements
- Overlay layers for UI components and controls
- Transient layers for temporary visualizations (like measurements)

This mental model aligns with GIS systems and design tools like Photoshop, making it intuitive for many users.

### Event-Driven Interactions

Think of the library as a reactive system where:

- User actions trigger events
- Components listen for relevant events
- The system responds by updating visualizations
- Changes propagate through the component hierarchy

## Approaching Common Tasks

### Creating Interactive Maps

When creating an interactive map:

1. **Start with the container**: Define the HTML element that will hold your map
2. **Initialize the map**: Create a Map instance with appropriate options
3. **Configure the environment**: Set up the grid, background, and initial view
4. **Add core layers**: Add your fundamental visual elements
5. **Wire up interactions**: Set up event handlers for user interaction

```javascript
// Thinking about map creation
const container = document.getElementById('map-container');
const map = new FabricLayers.Map(container, {
  width: 800,
  height: 600,
  showGrid: true,
  center: { x: 0, y: 0 }
});

// Now the map is ready for layers and interactions
```

### Managing Layers

When working with layers, think about:

1. **Layer hierarchy**: What stacking order makes sense for your application?
2. **Layer grouping**: Which elements should be managed together?
3. **Interaction permissions**: Which layers should respond to user input?
4. **Visual consistency**: How to maintain a coherent visual language?

```javascript
// Thinking about layer organization
const backgroundLayer = new FabricLayers.MarkerGroup(bounds, {
  fill: '#f0f0f0',
  stroke: 'none',
  zIndex: 10,  // Lower values are drawn first
  clickable: false // Background doesn't respond to clicks
});

const interactiveMarkers = new FabricLayers.MarkerGroup([], {
  zIndex: 100,  // Higher values are drawn on top
  clickable: true
});

// Add to map in any order - z-index controls rendering order
backgroundLayer.addTo(map);
interactiveMarkers.addTo(map);
```

### Handling User Interactions

When designing interactions:

1. **Mode-based thinking**: What mode is the user in (select, draw, measure)?
2. **Event flow**: How do events propagate through your application?
3. **Feedback loops**: How do users receive visual feedback about their actions?
4. **State management**: How do you track and manage application state?

```javascript
// Thinking about interaction modes
const modeSelect = document.getElementById('mode-select');
modeSelect.addEventListener('change', (e) => {
  const mode = e.target.value;
  
  // Conceptually switching the entire system's behavior
  map.setMode(mode);
  
  // Update UI to reflect the current mode
  updateUIForMode(mode);
  
  // Different event handlers become active based on mode
  if (mode === 'MEASURE') {
    // Prepare measurement tools
    initializeMeasurementTools();
  }
});
```

## Architectural Thinking

### Separation of Concerns

When building with fabric-layers-core, consider these separate concerns:

1. **Data management**: How you store and structure your spatial data
2. **Visual representation**: How that data is rendered on the canvas
3. **User interaction**: How users manipulate the data
4. **Business logic**: How your application's rules apply to the map

Keeping these concerns separated makes your code more maintainable.

### Extending vs. Composing

When adding functionality, consider whether to:

- **Extend existing classes**: Create specialized versions of Marker or Layer
- **Compose with existing components**: Use combinations of existing components
- **Use the event system**: Listen for events and react accordingly

```javascript
// Extension approach
class CustomMarker extends FabricLayers.Marker {
  constructor(position, options) {
    super(position, options);
    // Add custom functionality
  }
  
  // Add custom methods
  highlight() {
    this.setOptions({ stroke: 'yellow', strokeWidth: 3 });
  }
}

// Composition approach
function createComplexElement(position) {
  const group = new FabricLayers.Layer();
  
  const marker = new FabricLayers.Marker(position);
  const label = new FabricLayers.Tooltip(position, { text: 'Label' });
  
  // Add both to map but manage them together
  marker.addTo(map);
  label.addTo(map);
  
  return { marker, label };
}
```

### State Management Patterns

Consider these patterns for managing state:

1. **Event-based state**: React to events to update application state
2. **Centralized state**: Maintain a single source of truth
3. **Object-oriented state**: Encapsulate state within objects
4. **Immutable updates**: Create new state rather than modifying existing state

## Performance Considerations

When thinking about performance:

1. **Object creation**: Create objects only when needed
2. **Event handlers**: Use throttling for high-frequency events
3. **Visual complexity**: Adjust detail based on zoom level
4. **Rendering optimization**: Use layer visibility to control rendering

```javascript
// Thinking about dynamic detail levels
map.on('zoom', (e) => {
  const zoom = e.zoom;
  
  // Show more detail at higher zoom levels
  if (zoom > 2) {
    detailLayer.setVisible(true);
    labelLayer.setVisible(true);
  } else {
    detailLayer.setVisible(false);
    labelLayer.setVisible(false);
  }
  
  // Adjust marker size based on zoom
  markers.forEach(marker => {
    marker.setOptions({
      radius: baseRadius / zoom
    });
  });
});
```

## Integration Patterns

When integrating with other systems:

1. **Data adapters**: Create adapters to transform external data
2. **Component bridges**: Build bridge components between systems
3. **Event mapping**: Map library events to application events
4. **Rendering pipelines**: Create clear flow of data to visualization

```javascript
// Thinking about data integration
function loadGeoJSON(url) {
  fetch(url)
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => {
      // Transform GeoJSON to fabric-layers objects
      data.features.forEach(feature => {
        if (feature.geometry.type === 'Point') {
          const position = transformCoordinates(feature.geometry.coordinates);
          const marker = new FabricLayers.Marker(position, {
            // Map properties to visual attributes
            color: getColorForFeature(feature),
            label: feature.properties.name
          });
          marker.addTo(map);
          
          // Connect back to original data
          marker.data = feature.properties;
        }
        // Handle other geometry types
      });
    });
}
```

## Thinking in Events

The event system is central to fabric-layers-core. Think of your application as responding to a flow of events:

1. **User events**: Direct interactions from the user
2. **System events**: Changes in the system state
3. **Data events**: Updates to underlying data
4. **Visual events**: Completion of animations or transitions

This event-driven thinking helps create responsive, decoupled applications.

## Conclusion

Working effectively with fabric-layers-core means thinking in terms of:

- Maps as viewports into a larger world
- Layers as organized visual elements
- Events as the communication mechanism
- Modes as different interaction contexts

By approaching the library with these mental models, you can create powerful, interactive canvas applications with clear, maintainable code structure.
