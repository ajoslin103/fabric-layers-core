# monorepo nx yarn fabric.js react
Project: fabric-layers
- Monorepo structure using Nx
- Package manager: Yarn v1
- Node version management: NVM (currently v22.16.0)
- Contains two main packages:
  1. fabric-layers-core: A fabric.js coordinate-plane (grid) & layers library
  2. fabric-layers-react: React wrapper around fabric-layers-core
- Key demos:
  - fabric-layers-core/grid-demo.html
  - fabric-layers-react/plane-demo.html
- Important: Use fabric-layers components/classes instead of native fabric.js routines
- Built against fabric@5.5.2-browser to avoid issues with canvas in the browser (note the -browser suffix)
